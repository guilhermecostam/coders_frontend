# Contributing Guideline

Here you will find all the guidelines to contribute to the project

## Let's Contribute
- **Step 1** - Fork this repository (ignore if you are a repository contributor).
- **Step 2** - Clone the repository to your local machine.
- **Step 3** - Create a branch for your change.
- **Step 4** - Add the changes to repository.
- **Step 5** - Create a PULL Request for the `dev` branch. And that's all.
- **NOTE** - Please follow the other patterns described below. It will be very important for a productive code review and for the quality of the project.

## Patterns for commits and branches
To name branches, you will need to use a specific pattern. Basically you link the type of change with the _number of the issue_ you are solving.

**Example:** `feat.10`

For commits it will be similar. For each new commit, you will use the nomenclature used in the current branch + your message.

**Example:** `fix.7: your_message_here`

For modifications, it is important that you separate the commits well. Instead of resolving the whole issue in a single commit, create a commit for each changed file separately and explaining the change in the messages.

## Types of Changes

| Type | Explanation |
| :-------- | :-------- |
| feat | new implementations |
| fix | bug fixes |
| adjust | changes and adjustments |
| refactor | code refactoring |
| docs | documentation content |
| chore | no code change |

## Usability of issues
In this project we will use issues for task logging. If there is a relevant change, or you find a bug, just create a new issue and specify the task.
